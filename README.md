## 📋 Overview
Brion Quantum OS is a state-of-the-art quantum supercomputing stack. It brings together algorithms, backends like Cirq, Qiskit, and TensorFlow Quantum, and TPU-accelerated hybrid loops under one runtime. Our Particle Emitter System (PES) quickly sets up and reconfigures qubit resources. This feature speeds up prepare–measure cycles, making tasks like Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) easier and more efficient.

## ⚙️ System Requirements
To run Brion Quantum OS smoothly, you should have the following:

- **Operating System:** Windows 10 or later, macOS 10.15 or later, or a recent version of a Linux distribution.
- **Processor:** 2.0 GHz dual-core or higher.
- **RAM:** At least 8 GB.
- **Disk Space:** Minimum of 1 GB available space.
